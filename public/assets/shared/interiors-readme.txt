Thanks for downloading the Hana Caraka - Fantasy Interior. 
-Made by: Otterisk 

Please let me know if you have any ideas for this pack.

Note:
The grid size for structures, walls, and floors is 16.
The grid size for props is 8.
You must slice the props by a multiple of 8, i.e. 8, 16, 24, and so on.
The pivot point for props is also a number multiple of 8.
